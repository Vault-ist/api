## Step 1: Authorization in the Sandbox

To utilize the sandbox, navigate to the following link:

To do this, open the `Sign up` section. 

Select **POST /v2/mobile/signup** and click `Try it out`.

> - [x] **password**: This is your existing password if you already have an account, or a new password you want to set for your account.

## Step 3: Phone number confirmation

After registering a new customer, it is necessary to confirm the phone number. 

To do this, select **POST /v2/mobile/phone/confirm**, which is located in the same section and click `Try it out`.

Upon completing the request, an response with a status of 200 will be received, containing a data block, including the **access_token**.


## Step 4: Entering the access_token

Copy the obtained access_token and return to the **Available authorization** window.  
In the `Value` field, paste the copied **access_token** and click the `Authorize` button.
